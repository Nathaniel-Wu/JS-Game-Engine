            <p>
                This tutorial demonstrates how to build a game using the engine, but it's highly abstract, most parts need to be modified
                according to your own game.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Setup HTML and JS</h4>
            <p>
                On your HTML page, include the engine JavaScript, then use a wrapper such as div, to wrap a canvas, and make sure that your
                wrapper has an id of "game", and your canvas has an id of "canvas", other wise the engine won't operate as
                planned; of couse, you need to include your game specific JavaScript as well, it's recommended to include
                it in the body rather than in the head.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    &lt;head&gt;
        ……
        &lt;script src="engine.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        ……
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        ……
        &lt;div id="game"&gt;
            &lt;canvas id="canvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;script src="your_game.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        ……
    &lt;/body&gt;
    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Then in your game script, you can wirte a subclass of Game to start.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    class YourGame extends Game {
        ……
    }
    var game = new YourGame();
    game.start();
    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now it's time to start working on your game.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Define Resources of Your Game</h4>
            <p>
                Your game must consist of something, right? Thus you need to declare them first in the game constructor. You also need to
                define how to load and deload everything.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    class YourGame extends Game {
        constructor(){
            super(60); //Set framerate to 60 Hz.
            this.something = null; //Your objects.
        }

        load(){
            this.something = new Something(); //Initialize your objects.
        }

        deload(){
            this.something.destroy(); //Destroy your objects.
            this.something = null;
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
            <p>
                A real game will look more complicated than this, but you get the idea. Make sure you destroy or recycle your stuff on deload,
                it's important.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3: Define How Your Recources Update and Draw</h4>
            <p>
                A game is basically a running loop, you need to update your objects according to your game's logic, and eventually draw them
                out. So that's what you need to do in this step,
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    class YourGame extends Game {
        ……
        update(){
            super.update();
            this.something.update();
        }

        draw(){
            super.draw();
            this.something.draw();
        }
        ……
    }
    </code></pre>
            <p>
                The original Game update() and draw() are important in loop management, make sure you invoke them first in your overrode
                version. A real game's update() can be much more complicated than this, but draw() is usually simple, you
                sould keep rendering details in your object classes.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4: Define The Objects</h4>
            <p>
                Similar to your game, objects in it needs to be initialized at the start, updated and drawed in every game loop, and eventually
                be destroyed.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    class Something extends Sprite {//Sprite and its many subclasses are the most used ones, if you want to have more flexibility, inherit GObject.
        constructor(){
            super(x, y, w, h);//You should use actual numbers here, to define its location and size.
            //Define attributes
        }

        update(){
            super.update();
            //Do stuff
        }

        actual_draw() {
            super.actual_draw();
            //Do stuff
        }

        destroy(){
            super.destroy();
            //Do stuff
        }
        ……
    }
    </code></pre>
            <p>
                One thing to note here is that you should always override actual_draw() rather than draw(), because classes higher in the
                inheritance tree does rotation for you, which need to do stuff before and after actual_draw(). Also, keep
                in mind that you need to invoke the inherited versions of functions first, but if you do need to completely
                rewrite one or two, read the source codes of engine first to ensure that you won't break something.

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Use Collision Detection</h2>
            <p>
                This tutorial demonstrates how to use engine built-in collision detection, but it's highly abstract, most parts need to be
                modified according to your own game.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Inherit CollidableGObject or Its Subclasses</h4>
            <p>
                Collision detection are provided by CollidableGObject class.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Implement move_prediction(), collides() and resolve()</h4>
            <p>
                Collision detection are provided by CollidableGObject class.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    class Something extends Sprite{
        ……
        move_prediction() {
            return new Something();
            //You should return a instance that has the intended position and velocity set,
            //so the engine could invoke the specific collision determination function of this class,
            //this instance will be destroyed by engine automatically after that.
        }
    
        collides(CGO) {
            super.collides(CGO);
            //Do stuff that determines whether it collides with the CollidableGObject passed in, your return value should be boolean.
            //Sometimes you will probably need to rewrite this function without calling super function.
            //For most of the situations, you don't need to add new codes to or rewrite this function.
        }
    
        resolve(collision) {
            super.resolve(collision);
            //Do stuff that handles the collision, this is a instance of class Collision.
            //Check out class Collision's source codes for more detail.
        }
        ……
    }
    </code></pre>
            <h4>Step 3: Invoke CGO_update() in game update</h4>
            <p>
                CGO_update() is a static function of CollidableGObject, it uses quad-tree and other acceleration techniques to discard unnecessary
                collision checks.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
class YourGame extends Game{
    ……
    update(){
        ……
        CollidableGObject.CGO_update();
        ……  
    }
    ……
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                One thing you need to pay attention to is that your should invoke CGO_update() before any CollidableGObject actually updates
                in your game update. If you do have all the logic done correctly, the collision detection should be operating
                smoothly.

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Use Input Listening</h2>
            <p>
                This tutorial demonstrates how to use engine built-in input listening, but it's highly abstract, most parts need to be modified
                according to your own game.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Subscribe to Engine Input Event Manager</h4>
            <p>
                This step doesn't need to inherit any class, it's a composition. Just keep a reference of engine's input manager, and the
                subscriber index of your object.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
class Something{
    constructor(){
        ……
        this.iesm = input_event_subscription_manager;
        //input_event_subscription_manager is a global variable of engine, but it's not necessarily always the same one, it can be swapped.
        this.si = this.iesm.add_subscriber(this);
        ……
    }

    destroy(){
        ……
        this.iesm.remove_subscriber(this.si);
        this.si = null;
        this.iesm = null;
        ……
    }
}        
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Aside from subscribe, remember to unsubscribe when you destroy the object.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Define How to Handle Certain Input</h4>
            <p>
                The engine's input manager will always be invoking its subscriber's handle_input_event() function.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
class Something{
    ……
    handle_input_event(event) {
        switch (event.type) {
            case IEType.……://IEType is a enummeration object constant in engine. 
                try {
                    this.input_event_subscription_manager.set_exclusive(this.si, IEType.……);
                    //Do something about the input
                    this.input_event_subscription_manager.release_exclusive(this.si, IEType.……);
                } catch (e) {console.log(e);} 
                break;
        }
    }
    ……
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                There is a set_exclusive() and release_exclusive() process, the former tells the engine that it's the only subscriber that
                handles the certain type of input, until it releases the lock. This provides some flexibility, for certain
                reasons you might need to not release lock until some conditions meet, or maybe you don't need to set lock
                becuase various instances needs the same input.
